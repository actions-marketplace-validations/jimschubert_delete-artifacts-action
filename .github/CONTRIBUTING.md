## Contributing

:+1: Thanks for offering to contribute to this project. Every contribution is greatly appreciated.

### Code of Conduct

Everyone contributing to this project must adhere to the [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

If you feel that someone is not upholding this code, please reach out to the repository owner(s) via email to open a discussion.

### Issues

Issues help drive open source and innovation. Project owners may not be aware of bugs or missing features if there are no issues tracking these.

As such, please search for an existing issue before opening a new issue. Duplicate issues may be closed and redirected to the original issue, but this takes time from project maintainers if issues are regularly duplicated.

Do open issues for questions, feature requests, proposals, bug reports, etc. Please do not open an issue for typos or other simple fixes; open a pull request instead.

### Pull Requests

Pull Requests should follow a few simple rules listed below. Reasons why these rules exist and caveats are also documented where appropriate.

* The title must clearly define the work.
  - This allows maintainers to prioritize pull requests at a high level
  - This saves time because maintainers don't need to traverse the list of pull requests to read descriptions of the work
  - **Caveat** Pull requests with vague titles may be closed without commit (e.g. Use `Fix typo of 'excldue'` rather than `Fix typo`)
* The description should expand on the work if it is not clearly represented in the title.
  - Linking to related issues and providing inputs/outputs of new behaviors helps maintainers and future users understand the contribution
* Commit messages must be clear and concise, but not _too_ concise.
  - Writing [good commit messages](https://thoughtbot.com/blog/5-useful-tips-for-a-better-commit-message) results in quality history in every repository
  - Explain why the commit was created, how it functions at a high level, and who/what this may affect
  - There are some times when a commit may be subject-only, but these are rare. Examples may include `Bump version to 1.0` or `Add X as contributor`
